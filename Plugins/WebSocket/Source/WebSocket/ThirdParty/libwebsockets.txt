building the libwebsocket for UE4.  Target is windows, 64 bits.

1. Get libwebsockets off github.  Check out the v3.1 stable branch (or whichever branch you intend to use)
2. Read the READMEs/README.build.md

3. Install cmake as instructed for your windows machine

4. Install OpenSSL developer libraries.  You need the 1.0.x series.  Download from here https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html don't use the 'light' version, and install everything in default place (c:/Program Files/OpenSSL-Win64)

Note that UE4.22 has upgraded openssl to 1.1.0 so you need to install that.

5. construct the projects by running cmake.  For help on cmake options, see the CMakeLists.txt file under the root.
	- Open a Visual studio command shell (Win64)
	- First create a "build" folder under the root and cd into it.
	- execute cmake, here are the options:
	- -G "Visual Studio 15 Win64"  (for win64 and VS2017)
	- -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=d:\inst  (or wherever, just not c:\Program Files\)
	- ..  (the source dir)

Verify that CMake has found the correct verision of openssl.

6. Open the visual studio project.  Select solution configuration Release or Debug.  Build INSTALL

7. Copy the include files generated in the d:\inst to the include folder.  Comment out the include of <openssl/ssl.h> and
   instead, add dummy declerations for the following structs:  
struct SSL_CTX;
struct SSL;
struct EVP_MD;
struct EVP_MD_CTX;
struct BIGNUM;
struct RSA;
This is because the headers conflict with some definitions in the UE4 headers. 

8. copy the libwebsockets_static.lib to the lib folder.  For 4.22 it is called libwebsocket_static422, because
   4.22 contains a different openssl third party library and linking needs to match
